Most job seekers don’t know how to write a proper cover letter. They believe a cover letter is
just a “here is my resume” note. This is a wasted opportunity!
In this article, you’ll discover the secret to writing a professional cover letter that’s truly
eﬀective. It’s not hard to do and will give you a signiﬁcant edge over the competition. We’ll walk
you through the process in a few straightforward steps and provide examples to help you along
the way.
Ready to get started? Let’s dive in and create a cover letter that opens doors to your next
opportunity.
What is a cover letter and do you really
need one?
A cover letter is a short document (around 300 words) that accompanies your resume. Your
cover letter should not simply repeat what your resume says. It should back up your resume,
reﬂect your personality, and address any weaknesses that could keep you from landing an
interview.
But do you really need a cover letter in 2025? The short answer is, ‘YES’.
“Over 80% of hiring managers read a cover letter and 60% of applications require one as part of
the application,” says career coach Madelyn Mackie. “Even hiring managers and recruiters who
say they never read cover letters may ﬁnd themselves drawn in by a particularly compelling
letter.”

What’s the biggest cover letter mistake?
The biggest mistake job seekers make in their cover letters is focusing only on themselves.
“It’s not about you,” says career coach Susan Schwartz. “It’s about what you can do for them.
Talking to them about what they care about—not about what you want—is what’s going to
make them want to read your letter. And to hire you!”
According to Schwartz, this is the best way to write your cover letter:
Paragraph 1. A single sentence (maximum two) stating the PROBLEM that the
company faces. What is the issue/need/opportunity that this role will address?
Paragraph 2. What SOLUTION do you oﬀer? How are you the answer to their need?
Again, keep it to a sentence or two.
Paragraph 3. EXPLANATION: What experience supports your claim that you can
help? This paragraph can be 3-4 sentences, but keep it short.
Paragraph 4. CALL TO ACTION: Suggest next steps. Not “thank you” but let’s plan to
discuss this next week.
Hiring managers spend only seconds on applications. So, your cover letter must grab their
attention and make them want to read your resume. By highlighting how your experience

matches the job, you make it easier for them to see you as a great ﬁt for the role.
Now let’s examine each of these steps in more detail.
How to write a strong cover letter step-by-
step
Now that you know the basics for your cover letter, let’s go through the steps. This will help you
write a cover letter that makes you stand out from other candidates.
1. Do your research
Research the company before writing your cover letter. This helps you know its challenges and
goals. Check the company website. Read the latest news and press releases. Also, follow them
on social media.
Don’t skip this step! Writing a cover letter is key. It helps you connect with employers and
stands out among other candidates.
After you’ve researched the company, carefully read the job description. Ask yourself the
following questions:
ASK YOURSELF:
What speciﬁc problems or challenges is this role designed to address?
How do my skills and experiences align with the job requirements?
Am I a good ﬁt for the role?
What unique value can I bring to the company in this role?
Are there any keywords or phrases that I should incorporate into my cover letter?
After researching the company and the role, you’re ready to start writing your cover letter.

2. Write your opening paragraphs
Many job seekers make the mistake of being too wordy in their cover letters. You’re not writing
a novel. Use short words in short sentences. Remember, a hiring manager is going to quickly
scan your application, so you need to get right to the point.
Here are some examples of how to start your cover letter:
EXAMPLE #1
“Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],
I’ve noticed that NexGen is working hard to stand out in a crowded digital market, and
keeping your brand top-of-mind for customers can be tough.
That’s where I come in—I specialize in creating engaging content and smart SEO
strategies that boost online presence and drive customer engagement.”
EXAMPLE #2
“Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],
I understand that Weissman is seeking to maintain its innovative edge in the dancewear
industry while consistently meeting sales and margin targets.
I am conﬁdent that my experience and passion for design can help Weissman continue
to create stunning, market-leading dancewear.”
EXAMPLE #3
“Dear [Hiring Manager’s Name],
I understand that Timmons Company needs motivated individuals to manage sales
territories and boost product visibility in retail grocery stores around Quincy, IL.
I am excited to bring my self-motivation and sales-oriented mindset to your team,
ensuring your products not only maintain their shelf presence but also thrive.”

3. Prove you can do the job
Now you need to provide evidence that you’re the right person for the job. The best way to do
this is to highlight your relevant experience and achievements. Here are some things you
should focus on:
Speciﬁc Accomplishments: Provide examples of your successes. This could include
increasing sales, leading projects, or improving processes.
Relevant Skills: Highlight skills that match the job, like planning, organizing, technical
abilities, or industry experience.
Problem-Solving: Share moments when you faced challenges. Talk about how you ﬁxed
problems, handled conﬂicts, or put solutions into action.
Industry Knowledge: Show that you know the ﬁeld well. Be aware of current trends and
standards.
Teamwork: Share your experiences of working well in teams, assisting others, or
collaborating with various departments.
Remember to keep it concise. Your letter shouldn’t cover your entire story. Instead, it should
show you understand the job’s key points.
Your goal is to leave the reader eager to learn more about you. Here are some examples:
EXAMPLE #1
“Over the past ﬁve years, I’ve led digital marketing campaigns that ramped up organic
traﬃc by 40% and bumped up conversion rates by 25%. I’ve worked with diverse teams
to create compelling content that resonates with audiences and used data analytics to
reﬁne strategies for maximum impact. My experience with social media management
and email marketing also ensures a holistic approach to your digital marketing needs.”
EXAMPLE #2
“With over ten years in apparel design, specializing in activewear and dancewear, I have
a proven track record of developing designs that resonate with customers and drive
sales. My expertise includes conducting global trend research, selecting inspiring
materials, and leading teams to transform creative concepts into market-ready products.

https://www.jobscan.co/blog/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/ 6/27
I am proﬁcient in Adobe Creative Suite and have experience with CLO3D, ensuring that
my designs are both innovative and technically sound. My leadership skills have been
honed by mentoring junior designers and managing cross-functional teams, fostering a
collaborative and eﬃcient design process.”
EXAMPLE #3
“With several years of experience in CPG retail sales and merchandising, I have
successfully managed sales territories, maintained product placements, and executed
promotional strategies. My ability to plan and organize, combined with proﬁciency in
Microsoft Oﬃce and familiarity with iPads, positions me well to contribute eﬀectively to
your sales team. I am adept at thinking on my feet and delivering results in dynamic
environments, ensuring that products are always tagged, rotated, and optimally
displayed.”
4. Conclude with a call to action
To ﬁnish your cover letter, add a strong call to action in the last paragraph. It’s not only about
saying thanks. It’s also about preparing for the next steps in hiring.
Instead of just saying “thank you,” suggest a speciﬁc plan. For example, propose a meeting or a
call. This way, you can discuss how you can help the company.
Here are some examples of how to end a cover letter:
EXAMPLE #1
“Let’s discuss how I can help NexGen Creative Agency achieve its sales goals next week.
Please let me know your availability for a meeting.”
EXAMPLE #2
“How about we chat next week about how I can help Weissman shine even brighter? Let
me know when you’re free.”
EXAMPLE #3 Skip to content

“Let’s plan to discuss how my self-motivation and sales-oriented mindset can boost
product visibility for Timmons Company next week. Please let me know your availability
for a meeting.”
There is no need to add anything more. Time is valuable, so hiring managers won’t spend it on
a cover letter that isn’t concise and to the point.

Expert tips for writing a cover letter
We’ve gone over the basics of how to write a good cover letter. Here are some expert tips for
formatting and how to make your cover letter even better.
Format your contact information correctly
Before you write your cover letter, format your contact details and header correctly. You’ll need
to include your name, full address, phone number, and email address.
Here’s an example:
Personalize your greetingSkip to content
10/25/25, 10:29 AM How to Write a Cover Letter That Gets You a Job Interview
https://www.jobscan.co/blog/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/ 9/27
To whom should you address your cover letter? “For maximum impact, see if you can ﬁnd the
hiring manager or recruiter for the role, and send your letter to them,” says career coach Susan
Schwarz. “Addressing your letter to a speciﬁc person will signiﬁcantly increase the likelihood of
someone reading it.”
Check the company’s website or LinkedIn proﬁle to ﬁnd the name of the hiring manager.
However, if you can’t ﬁnd a speciﬁc name, “Dear Hiring Manager” will suﬃce.
To end your cover letter, you can use “best regards” or “kind regards” followed by your full
name.
Tailor your cover letter to the company
Your cover letter has to answer the question: why you? Why are you the best candidate for the
job, and how are you uniquely qualiﬁed to tackle the role?
Here are some tips to optimize your cover letter for the opportunity you’re applying for.
HOW TO TAILOR YOUR COVER LETTER
Learn about the company: Check their website, read news articles, and look at
their social media. Find out their challenges and goals.
Analyze the job description: Identify the role’s speciﬁc needs and how your skills
align.
Highlight relevant experience: Focus on accomplishments, skills, problem-solving,
industry knowledge, and teamwork.
Show your personality
Keep a professional tone in your cover letter. Also, let your personality shine through. But
remember, you don’t want to overdo it—keep it concise and relevant.
Here are some ways to show your personality in your cover letter:

https://www.jobscan.co/blog/how-to-write-a-cover-letter/ 10/27
HOW TO SHOW YOUR PERSONALITY
Brieﬂy mention a speciﬁc project or experience you enjoyed.
Highlight a distinctive skill or trait that sets you apart.
Talk about how your values align with the company’s mission or culture.
Describe a unique volunteer experience.
Emphasize your adaptability
According to LinkedIn, the top “skill of the moment” is adaptability. This means being open to
new ideas, ready to pivot when needed, and always looking for ways to improve. In a world
where the only constant is change, being adaptable can set you apart.
Here’s an example of how to incorporate adaptability into your cover letter:
“In my previous role as a CPG retail sales merchandiser, I consistently demonstrated my
ability to adjust to changing market conditions, customer preferences, and sales
strategies. This adaptability allowed me to increase sales by 25% in a highly competitive
market.”
Show enthusiasm
Research shows that 40% of employers would not hire a candidate if they lacked enthusiasm.
Remember, you’re much more attractive to employers when you’re on ﬁre.
Here’s an example of how to show enthusiasm for the company you’re applying to:
“I’ve long admired Weissman’s commitment to the dance community and the artistry of
your costumes. Your dedication to empowering performances and celebrating creativity

is inspiring, and I’m excited about the opportunity to join your passionate team.”
Balance professionalism with friendliness
Try to strike a balance between a professional and friendly tone. Don’t use overly formal
language, but make sure your writing is polished and error-free. Use humor sparingly, as it can
be easily misinterpreted.
This approach helps you come across as both competent and personable, making you an ideal
candidate.
