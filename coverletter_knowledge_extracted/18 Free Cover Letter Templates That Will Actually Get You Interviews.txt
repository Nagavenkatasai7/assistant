Jobscan’s cover letter templates are clean and professional. We intentionally avoided using ﬂashy colors
and design elements when creating them. Why?
Because most companies nowadays use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to screen resumes and cover
letters. These systems can struggle to read and interpret visually complex documents.
This means your beautifully designed, eye-catching cover letter might remain stuck in an ATS database,
never to be seen by an actual human being.
By using one of our simple, easy-to-read templates, you’ll signiﬁcantly improve the chances that your
cover letter will successfully pass through an ATS and into the hands of a hiring manager.
It’s super easy to get started too! Simply click the download button to get your hands on a Word document
that you can customize to ﬁt your unique situation.
When you’re done writing your cover letter, run it through Jobscan’s ATS-friendly cover letter checker to
get personalized feedback on how to improve your letter and make it even more compelling to employers.

What is a cover letter?
It’s a letter of introduction that you send along with your resume when you apply for a job.
The key thing to remember about your cover letter is that it shouldn’t simply regurgitate your
resume. Instead, it should support it.
Your cover letter can do this by:
Explaining why you’re excited about the job opportunity.•

applicants and increase your chances of landing an interview.

hiring decision.
In fact, most of the respondents in that survey claimed that a great cover letter might get you an
interview even if your resume isn’t strong enough.
So don’t skip the cover letter! When done correctly, it can be a powerful tool in your job search
toolkit.

Greetings: Address the letter to the hiring manager or the person who will be reviewing
your application.
Opening paragraph: State the position you’re applying for and explain how you found out
about the job. You can also brieﬂy mention why you’re interested in the position and the
company.
Body paragraphs: Use one or two paragraphs to highlight your relevant skills, experience,
and qualiﬁcations that match the job requirements. Provide speciﬁc accomplishments
examples and how they show oﬀ your abilities.
Closing paragraph: Repeat your interest in the position and thank the hiring manager for
considering your application. You can also include a sentence or two about why you
believe you’d be a good ﬁt for the company culture.
Closing: Conclude your cover letter with a professional sign-oﬀ, such as “Best regards,” or
“Sincerely”.
Do you need a unique cover letter for every
job?
Absolutely! Do NOT use the exact same cover letter and simply change the name of the company
and the position.
Instead, tailor each cover letter to the position you’re applying for.
You can do this by highlighting how your skills and experience match the speciﬁc requirements
and responsibilities of the position.
It’s crucial to include the keywords that are in the job posting.
Why? Because your application will most likely go straight into an ATS database. Hiring managers
search through this database for suitable job candidates by typing keywords into the search bar.
If your cover letter includes these keywords, it will be seen by the hiring manager. If it doesn’t
include these keywords, your cover letter will remain in the database.

school projects, internships, volunteer work, or extracurricular activities. Be sure to

expressing your interest in discussing the position further.

FAQs
Q: How long should a cover letter be?

Most cover letters are too long. The ideal length is around 250-400 words. Hiring managers

Q: Can I email my cover letter instead of sending a cover
letter?
Either one should be ﬁne. Some older ATS might not accept PDFs, but this is rare these days.
Always check the job listing. If it says to submit a Word resume, then do that. Otherwise, a PDF
resume works just as well.
Yes, you can email your cover letter instead of sending a physical copy through the mail. In fact,
many employers now prefer to receive cover letters and resumes via email or through an online
application system.
