If you’re applying for jobs, chances are you’ve dreaded writing a cover letter.
They can be time-consuming, repetitive, and tough to get right, especially when you’re not sure
what to say or how to say it without sounding generic.
But are cover letters really necessary?
In most cases, yes! According to Jobscan’s State of the Job Search report, applicants who
included a cover letter were 3.4 times more likely to land an interview. It demonstrates that
you’re thoughtful, motivated, and serious about the role.
That’s where ChatGPT comes in. With the right prompt, it can help you write a professional,
personalized cover letter in less time.
This guide will show you how to write a cover letter that actually gets attention, without
sounding like everyone else.

What ChatGPT can (and can’t) do
ChatGPT is a free AI tool that can help you write a cover letter, but it needs the right input.
If your prompt is too vague, you’ll get a bland, generic draft that could apply to anyone. That’s
because ChatGPT doesn’t know your background, your accomplishments, or why you want the
job, unless you tell it.
ChatGPT works by responding to prompts. These are instructions that guide what it writes and
how it writes it. The better your prompt, the better the result.
Should you use ChatGPT to write a cover letter? Yes, but it has its pros and cons. While ChatGPT
is a powerful tool, like any tool, it works best when you use it with care.
How to write a ChatGPT cover letter in 3
simple steps
Now that you know what ChatGPT can (and can’t) do, here’s how to actually use it to write a
great cover letter—fast.
Step 1: Gather your materials
To get started, tell ChatGPT that you need a cover letter. You can also provide some basic
information about the job you’re applying for and what you’d like to emphasize in your cover
letter.
You’ll need the following:
The job description: This is where you’ll ﬁnd the keywords, responsibilities, and
company values you’ll want to reference in your letter.
Your resume or LinkedIn proﬁle: ChatGPT needs to understand your background. Use
your resume or copy your LinkedIn proﬁle so it knows your experience, skills, and
accomplishments.
A few key achievements: Think of 2–3 speciﬁc accomplishments that show the kind of
results you deliver. Bonus points if they include numbers.

https://www.jobscan.co/blog/use-chatgpt-to-generate-a-cover-letter/ 3/20
Why you want the job: This is one of the easiest things to overlook. But it’s also one of
the most important. What interests you about the company? The role? What’s your
“why”?
Once you’ve got all of that ready, you’re set for step 2: writing the prompt.
Step 2: Use these prompts to write a cover letter with
ChatGPT
Once you’ve gathered your materials, it’s time to put them to work. The secret to getting a
strong draft from ChatGPT is using the right prompt.
Here are three prompt types you can use, depending on where you are in the process:
1. General cover letter prompt
If you’re applying to similar jobs and want a reusable draft, this prompt will help you build a
ﬂexible template you can customize later.
It doesn’t require a job description, just your background and key strengths.
Try this prompt:
This gives you a solid base to work from. Later, you can tweak a few lines to reﬂect a speciﬁc
role or company, without having to start from scratch every time.
2. Targeted cover letter prompt
If you’re applying to a speciﬁc job, this is the prompt you want to use. Unlike the general
template, this one requires the job description along with your resume or LinkedIn proﬁle.
ChatGPT will use both to tailor your cover letter so it matches the role you’re targeting.
•
General cover letter prompt
“Write a professional cover letter for a [job title] with [X years of experience]. Highlight 3–4
transferable skills, a few key accomplishments, and keep the tone clear and conﬁdent.
Make the letter easy to customize for future applications.”

https://www.jobscan.co/blog/use-chatgpt-to-generate-a-cover-letter/ 4/20
Try this prompt:
This helps ChatGPT align your skills, experience, and accomplishments with exactly what the
employer is looking for, making your application more targeted and eﬀective.
Here’s an example of what that prompt might look like in ChatGPT:
3. Conﬁdence and clarity booster prompt
If your letter feels too ﬂat or unsure, this prompt helps make your writing sharper and more
impactful.
Try this prompt:
Targeted cover letter prompt
“Using this job description and my resume, write a personalized cover letter that shows
why I’m a strong ﬁt for the role. Job description: [paste job description]. Resume: [paste
resume or LinkedIn proﬁle].”
Copy
Conﬁdence and clarity booster prompt
“Rewrite this cover letter to sound more conﬁdent. Use stronger action verbs and
emphasize measurable results. Keep the tone clear and professional.”

https://www.jobscan.co/blog/use-chatgpt-to-generate-a-cover-letter/ 5/20
You can also ask ChatGPT to rewrite speciﬁc sections, like the opening paragraph or your list of
accomplishments.
Step 3: Edit and personalize the AI output
Once ChatGPT gives you a draft, don’t just copy and paste it into your application. This step is
where you make the letter truly yours.
How to personalize your ChatGPT cover letter
1 Add your voice
Read your cover letter out loud. Does it sound like something you would say? If not,
tweak the tone until it feels natural and genuine.
2 Replace placeholders
ChatGPT may leave sections like “[Company Name]” or “[Insert Achievement]” blank.
Make sure you ﬁll in every missing detail before sending.
3 Verify the facts
Sometimes ChatGPT gets creative. Double-check that all experience, skills, dates, and
results are accurate.
4 Keep it concise
A good cover letter doesn’t need to be long. Aim for under 300 words. Short, focused,
and skimmable works best.
5 Match the tone to the company
A letter for a law ﬁrm shouldn’t sound the same as one for a creative agency. Adjust
your language and tone to reﬂect the industry.

To clarify a paragraph: “Rewrite this paragraph to make it clearer and more direct.”
You don’t have to start from scratch. Just guide ChatGPT to make focused improvements.
Don’t rely on ChatGPT too much
“Use ChatGPT as a tool to assist in the writing process, not as a
replacement for your input and eﬀort. Your insights,
experiences, and knowledge are not just important, they are
crucial to creating a compelling cover letter that truly represents
you.”
Clair Levy, Certiﬁed Executive Resume Writer
How to write prompts for speciﬁc
situations
Diﬀerent backgrounds call for diﬀerent strategies. These prompts are tailored to your
experience level, but to get the best results, you’ll also need to provide the right information
along with the prompt.
No experience / entry-level
If you’re just starting out, focus on what you’ve learned and how you’ve applied it. Academic
projects, volunteer work, and internships can show real value.
What to include along with the prompt:

Hiring managers (and ATS) scan for speciﬁc words related to skills, qualiﬁcations, and tools. This
prompt helps you identify those terms so you can naturally weave them into your application.
What to include: The full job description. ChatGPT will scan it for frequently mentioned skills,
qualiﬁcations, and tools, so you can mirror that language in your application.

company’s mission, values, or recent news can help your letter stand out. This prompt helps
you ﬁnd those details quickly.
What to include: The company name. You can also paste a link to their About or News page
for better results.

3. Turn your experience into a story (STAR method)
Using the STAR method—Situation, Task, Action, Result—helps you clearly communicate your
impact. This prompt turns a plain bullet point into a mini success story.
Here’s an example:
S = Situation: What was the context or background?
Example: “Customer satisfaction scores were dropping at our call center.”
T = Task: What was your responsibility or goal?
Example: “I was asked to identify the cause and improve the scores within three months.”
A = Action: What action did you do to address it?
Example: “I analyzed support call logs, discovered common pain points, and launched a new
training program focused on active listening and empathy.”
R = Result: What happened as a result of your action?
Example: “Customer satisfaction scores increased by 25%, and call resolution time dropped
by 15%.”
Final bullet: “Improved customer satisfaction scores by 25% and reduced call resolution
time by 15% by identifying service gaps in support call logs and launching a targeted training
program for staﬀ focused on active listening and empathy.”
What to include: A resume bullet point or a short description of a past achievement. ChatGPT
will rework it into the STAR format.
4. Write a stronger opening line
Your ﬁrst paragraph sets the tone for the rest of your cover letter. This prompt helps you craft
an opening that’s attention-grabbing and tailored to the job.
Turn your experience into a story prompt
“Rewrite this bullet point using the STAR method: [paste bullet].”

What to include: The job title, company name, job description, and a quick note about what
excites you about the role or why you’re a great ﬁt.
Even small improvements can make your application stronger. The more context you give
ChatGPT, the better its output will be, so always include your materials, not just the prompt.
ChatGPT cover letter do’s and don’ts
ChatGPT can save you time, but only if you use it wisely. These tips will help you avoid common
ChatGPT cover letter mistakes and make sure your cover letter still sounds personal, polished,
and professional.
Do’s
Paste company values into your
prompt so ChatGPT can reﬂect the
company’s tone and priorities.
Use storytelling frameworks like
STAR to make your experience
more engaging.
Ask for multiple versions of a
paragraph or sentence and choose
the one that sounds strongest.
Have it suggest alternative
phrasing when you’re stuck or
unsure how to word something.
Don’ts
Don’t copy and paste the draft
without reviewing it. AI-generated
text still needs editing.
Don’t forget to personalize the
letter with your voice and speciﬁc
reasons for applying.
Don’t include inaccurate or
made-up details. Always check for
factual correctness.
Don’t reuse the same letter for
every job. Generic content won’t
get you noticed.
Write a stronger opening line prompt
“Write an attention-grabbing opening paragraph for a cover letter applying to this job:
[paste job description]. I’m excited about this role because [insert reason].”

10/25/25, 10:29 AM How to Use ChatGPT to Write Your Cover Letter
https://www.jobscan.co/blog/use-chatgpt-to-generate-a-cover-letter/ 14/20
Should you use ChatGPT to write a cover
letter?
If you use it the right way, ChatGPT can be a powerful time-saver. It can help you write faster,
get unstuck, and generate ideas you might not have considered on your own.
But it’s just a tool. The most eﬀective cover letters still reﬂect your voice, your experience, and
your motivation.
Worried that employers will know you used AI?
Don’t be, as long as you personalize it. AI-generated text only stands out when it’s vague,
robotic, or clearly oﬀ-target. The best writing isn’t about being 100% original. It’s about being
clear, relevant, and real.
So use ChatGPT to speed up the process. Let it help you brainstorm, format, and ﬁne-tune. Just
make sure the ﬁnal version sounds like something you’d actually say.
That’s the diﬀerence between a forgettable form letter, and one that gets interviews.
Tips to make your ChatGPT cover letter
even better
Once you’ve used ChatGPT to generate a strong draft, the ﬁnal step is making it feel personal,
polished, and professional.
The following cover letter tips will help you reﬁne your letter, avoid common mistakes, and add
the ﬁnishing touches that make a real diﬀerence.
Tip #1. Know the diﬀerence between a cover letter vs.
a resume
It’s important to understand the diﬀerence between a cover letter and a resume. A resume
highlights your experience; a cover letter adds context, motivation, and personality.
Skip to content
10/25/25, 10:29 AM How to Use ChatGPT to Write Your Cover Letter
https://www.jobscan.co/blog/use-chatgpt-to-generate-a-cover-letter/ 15/20
If you’re unsure how the two complement each other, you can learn more about the diﬀerence
between cover letters and resumes and when to use each. You can also explore what a cover
letter can explain that a resume can’t to better understand its value in telling your story.
Tip #2. Address your cover letter properly
Your cover letter should feel like it’s written for a real person, not a faceless company. That’s
why it’s worth spending a few minutes trying to ﬁnd the hiring manager’s name.
Check the job posting, the company’s website, or even LinkedIn. But if you come up short, don’t
worry. There are still ways to make your letter feel personal and professional.
For a full breakdown of what to say—and what to avoid—this guide explains how to address a
cover letter even if you don’t have a direct contact.
Tip #3. Start with a strong opening paragraph
Start by making sure your opening paragraph grabs attention and clearly states why you’re
excited about the role. A strong introduction can set the tone for the entire letter and give the
hiring manager a reason to keep reading.
It should highlight what draws you to the company, what makes you a great ﬁt, and what you’re
hoping to contribute. Here’s how to start a cover letter that stands out, with examples and
strategies to get it right.
Tip #4. End your cover letter properly
As you wrap up, your closing lines matter too. This is your chance to leave a lasting impression.
Restate your interest, express conﬁdence, and invite next steps without sounding generic or
pushy. Learn how to end a cover letter in a way that reinforces your enthusiasm and
encourages a response.
And don’t overlook the ﬁnal detail: how you sign a cover letter can subtly reinforce
professionalism and polish.
