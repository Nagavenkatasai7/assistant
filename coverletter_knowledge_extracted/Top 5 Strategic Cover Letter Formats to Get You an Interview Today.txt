What is a cover letter and why does it
matter?
A cover letter  is a short document that is typically sent together with a resume , curriculum vitae,
portfolio, or other important attachments in a job application. Its main purpose is to highlight
details that are relevant to a job and that can improve a candidate’s chances of getting selected.
If you’re writing a cover letter, think of it as your one chance to show recruiters that you are what
they’re looking for.
Don’t waste it by writing a meh letter!
It shouldn’t be just a random attachment to your resume. It has to make recruiters want to get to
know you better.
Put your best foot forward using clear, descriptive language, and don’t be afraid to show oﬀ your
major accomplishments  and skills . If you have a letter ready, check out Jobscan’s cover letter
checker  to see if it’s doing all of that for you.
Beneﬁts of proper cover letter formatting
Following the proper cover letter format ensures that:
Your letter is easy to read through. Recruiters are busy people.  They go
through hundreds of applications. The right format makes it easy for them to
read through your letter from start to ﬁnish–a good thing for recruiters and a
plus for you.
You get to expound on important parts of your resume. The right cover letter
format provides space where you can brieﬂy explain why you’re a perfect match
without over-explaining your value.
Your letter is tailor-ﬁt to the job you’re applying for.  It provides space for you
to tailor your application to the job you’re applying for, as compared to sending a
generic cover letter (or, worse, no cover letter at all!).

How to format a cover letter
Date
Contact information
Regardless of which type you need to write, the general cover letter template  remains the same.
Follow this outline to write a winning cover letter:
This goes on the top left corner of your page. It doesn’t have to follow any speciﬁc date format, so
you can choose one you’re comfortable using.
On a hard copy, you will need to include a more detailed version of your contact information. This
goes below the date and should look like this:
Your Name
Home address
City, State, zip code
Contact number
Email address
Below this information is where the hiring manager’s information goes, which should look like
this:
Manager’s Name
Designation
Company Name
Oﬃce address
City, State, zip code
If you’re sending only a digital copy, your contact information should look like this:
Your Name
City, State
Skip to content

https://www.jobscan.co/cover-letter-formats 4/18
Contact number
Email address
Salutation
Below the date and contact information is where your greeting should go. Remember: An eye-
catching cover letter begins with a salutation that mentions the hiring manager’s name.
One major major mistake that applicants make is using impersonal ways to address the hiring
manager, such as “Dear Sir/Madam” or the long-outdated “To whom it may concern”. These fail
horribly at catching hiring managers’ attention and even show a lack of interest.
Another big mistake is indicating a name without verifying it’s the correct one. Few things are
worse than a letter with the wrong addressee name.
Addressing a hiring manager by name , on the other hand, eﬀectively grabs their attention. It has
the same eﬀect as when you hear someone calling your name on a crowded street. It will make
you turn to see who’s calling you.
So doing a bit of research on whose desk your letter will end up on will give you a signiﬁcant
edge. You’ll want hiring managers to know you’re addressing them personally, and that you are
genuinely enthusiastic about their company.
Examples of proper ways to start a cover are:
Dear Mr. Smith,
Greetings John,
Dear John,
• 
• 
• 
If you can’t ﬁnd the hiring manager’s name, you may also use these examples:
To the Editorial Team
Dear Jobscan Team
• 
•

Opening
Body
You can also use “Dear Hiring Manager”. However, this feels a bit too detached. A better way is to
address the speciﬁc team you’re looking to join.
This section is where you give a brief description of yourself. Highlight relevant skills,
accomplishments, and experiences that show you are a high-value candidate.
Keep this section no longer than one paragraph with only two to three short sentences in all. If
you have plenty of relevant accomplishments, pick only the best and most recent. You can
elaborate on your other experiences during the interview.
The body of the letter should only be one to two paragraphs long. This is the part where you
expound on the following details:
Why you’re applying for the job
What value you can add to the company or speciﬁc team
Quantiﬁable accomplishments that are relevant to the role
• 
• 
• 
Closing
Anyone can say they’re a convincing salesperson. But those with the results to prove it are
perceived as more reliable.
If you’re unsure how to beef up your cover letter’s body, you can use the cover letter optimizer  to
help you determine the best details to include.
End your cover letter with a closing section where you can sign oﬀ using professional closings,
such as:
Sincerely,
Best,

Respectfully,• 
Avoid using overly casual or inappropriate sign-oﬀs, such as:
Yours,
Yours Truly,
Cheers,
Warm Regards,
• 
• 
• 
• 
Also, keep the tone professional yet friendly.
The closing section is also where you may reiterate your interest in the company or a speciﬁc
position.
Pro Tip
Only touch on past experiences that you can back up with
numbers. Compared to vague claims about your track
record or accomplishments, measurable results are more
persuasive and give a clear picture of your strengths.

Dear Mr. Smith,
My ﬁve years of experience as a Human Resource professional has increased my passion

work environment. And I look forward to potentially joining your team and helping you
make it happen.
Sincerely,

Types of cover letter formats
There are ﬁve main types of cover letters :
Application
Prospecting
Networking
Career change
Email
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The ﬁrst four are your traditional formal letters, usually in block format and having only three to
four short paragraphs. Traditional cover letters also typically have a business-like tone, but
networking cover letters tend to be conversational and casual.
Aside from these four, there is another type of “cover letter” that is recently gaining popularity–
the email “cover letter”.
To know which of these best suits where you are in your job search, let’s ﬁnd out more about
these cover letter formats:
Application cover letter
The most common cover letter format is the application letter. This is what you would send to a
recruiter to supplement a resume or curriculum vitae. It should contain all details that are
relevant to the job ad and answer the question, “Why should we hire you?”
Here are ways you can make sure your letter matches the job post:
Touch brieﬂy on the company, such as its vision or culture.• 
Skip to content
10/25/25, 10:30 AM Top 5 Strategic Cover Letter Formats to Get You an Interview Today
https://www.jobscan.co/cover-letter-formats 9/18
Only include skills and achievements that match the job.
Use a cover letter analyzer  to ﬁnd out details to include, words to avoid, and
measurable results to increase your match rate.
• 
• 
Pro Tip
Pick only your best accomplishments and experiences, and
make sure that the cover letter is tailored for the job.
Recruiters who have gone through hundreds of
applications can spot a generic cover letter from a mile
away!
Prospecting cover letter
A prospecting cover letter is somewhat similar to an application cover letter. It’s something you
use when you’re searching for a job–only this time you’re not eyeing a speciﬁc post.
This is the type of cover letter template  that you would send when you’re interested in working
for a company and are eager to learn about open positions.
Otherwise, it will give the impression that you’re not sure how you can add value to the
organization.
This is an example of how NOT to write a prospecting letter:
“I have ﬁve years of experience as an HR professional, with displayed strengths in
compensation and beneﬁts and recruitment. I look forward to seeing if I am a good ﬁt for
any current openings in your company.”
Skip to content
10/25/25, 10:30 AM Top 5 Strategic Cover Letter Formats to Get You an Interview Today
https://www.jobscan.co/cover-letter-formats 10/18
In the example above, the applicant is able to communicate her skills and experience. However,
there is no mention of measurable results that show (instead of tell) that she indeed excels at
them.
The phrase “any current openings” without mention of preferences in job roles also makes it a
weak letter. It shows a lack of conﬁdence and passion, which results in a letter that doesn’t stand
out.
Here is an example of how to properly communicate your competencies in a prospecting letter:
“I am passionate about people and building a healthy work culture where everyone
thrives. As an Employee Wellness Manager, I reduced turnover rates across all
departments by 56 percent. I also implemented mental health programs and a hybrid
work setup for selected teams, which boosted employee morale by 40 percent.
I admire your company’s drive for equal opportunities, work-life balance, and a healthy
work environment. And I look forward to seeing if I am a good ﬁt for any HR-related roles.”
In this example, the applicant gives recruiters a clear idea regarding her skill sets, expertise, and
values. This makes it easy for hiring managers to determine whether she matches current
openings in line with her preference and area of expertise.
Pro Tip
Just because you’re not applying for a speciﬁc position
doesn’t mean you don’t need to have one in mind. Make
your prospecting letter more compelling by indicating
which roles or tasks you would excel at.

Networking cover letter
What better way to search for a job or get a recommendation than through friends? You can take
advantage of your professional network by sending former colleagues, acquaintances, or relevant
people in your circle a letter that lets them know you’re open to new work opportunities.
If you have a wide network, that’s great! However, you should avoid shooting just anyone in your
contacts list an email.
Here are some tips on how to make sure your letter produces the right results:
Choose contacts in leadership positions or with a say in hiring. Reach out to
strategic people with authority to hire, can aﬀect hiring decisions, or are
qualiﬁed to make a recommendation.
Reach out to people who can lead you to opportunities. If you don’t have
contacts who are hiring or have authority to hire, those who can lead you to
people who are can make your job search easier.
Contact former colleagues who can vouch for your work ethic or
accomplishments. It’s easier for people to recommend or hire you when they
know the value that you can add to their team. Having ﬁrst-hand experience with
your work ethic also helps people say with conﬁdence that you’re a good choice.
Initiate further conversation.  Be proactive by ending your letter with an
invitation to discuss opportunities. Show your eagerness by suggesting a time
and place or asking for their availability. Don’t end your letter without a call to
action or an opportunity to follow up.
Give them a call beforehand. If you have a close enough relationship, calling
them before sending the letter can give your job search a real boost. This way

they’re already expecting your letter and are most likely better able to respond
positively.
Career change letter
A career change cover letter  is similar to an application letter, only that it signiﬁes your intent to
apply for a job in a diﬀerent ﬁeld or line of work.
Here are some tips on how to make this cover letter format work:
Brieﬂy explain your reason for the career shift.  It’s natural for people to
wonder why you’re suddenly making a career change. Give a brief but
compelling answer to this in your letter. That way, recruiters understand why
without thinking it’s probably only because your previous job didn’t work out.
Highlight skills and experiences relevant to the role you’re applying for.
You would also want to put in a few words explaining why these skills make you
a good ﬁt for the role, especially if this is a shift to a completely unrelated
profession.
Keep it short. All cover letters should be short and sweet. Always assume that
whoever will get your letter is in a hurry. With a career change cover format, this
can be a challenge because of the added information you need to include. But
you can still make it concise by only picking important highlights and using
descriptive words.

Email “Cover Letter”
This ﬁfth cover letter format is a casual email that people typically send out when recruiters ask
for a resume but don’t require a formal cover letter. It’s usually very brief and meant to inform
recruiters that important documents have been attached to the email.

If you’re sending an email “cover letter”, make it work for you by brieﬂy stating why you’re
interested in the role and your most important relevant experience.
Pro Tip
Even if recruiters don’t ask for a cover letter, it’s a good idea to
send one anyway. Did you know that less than 40 percent of
candidates send a cover letter  even when recruiters ask for
one? Sending a well-crafted cover letter will give you a huge
advantage over other applicants.

How to format a cover letter for an internship?
A cover letter is a short document that is attached to a resume, curriculum vitae, or portfolio. It is
intended to expound on key skills and experiences on an applicant’s resume and help recruiters
choose candidates that best suit a job post.
To write a cover letter in block format, align all the sections of your cover letter to the left, set the
spacing to single in between sentences, and double in between paragraphs.
The block format is most commonly used in formal or business emails and letters.
To format a cover letter for an internship, you would still want to follow the general cover letter
format. You can still highlight skills and experiences in the body of your cover letter even if you
don’t have any actual work experience.
Here’s how:
List volunteer experiences and skills gained through each. You can also
brieﬂy explain how these skills are relevant to the program.
Include extra-curricular activities. Showcase those where you had an active or
leadership role, and describe competencies gained through each.
List relevant awards and recognitions. Pick only those that communicate
strengths applicable to the internship program.
