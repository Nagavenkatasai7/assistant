What is a cover
letter?
A cover letter is a concise, one-page
document submitted alongside your resume
as part of your job application. Its primary
purpose is to introduce yourself and provide
a brief overview of your professional
background. Ideally, a cover letter should
range between 250 and 400 words.
An eﬀective cover letter can highlight your
qualiﬁcations, giving hiring managers the
insights they need to decide if you’re a strong
candidate for an interview. On the other

hand, a poorly written one could lead to your
application being overlooked or even cost
you the opportunity.
To avoid such pitfalls, crafting a well-thought-
out cover letter is vital. Remember, a cover
letter is meant to complement your resume,
not duplicate it. Instead of repeating what’s
already on your resume, use it to elaborate
on your skills, qualiﬁcations, and aspects that
might not ﬁt on your resume such as
explaining a career gap or your motivation
for changing careers .
If writing a cover letter feels overwhelming,
don’t worry. Jobscan’s cover letter generator
can help overcome writer’s block. It pulls
relevant information from your resume and
the job description to create an optimized
cover letter tailored to your application.
Basic cover letter format
1. Header : Include your contact details.
2. Greeting : Address the hiring manager
directly using their name, if known.
3. Opening Paragraph : Start with an
attention-grabbing introduction that states
your experience and the position you’re
applying for.
4. Second Paragraph : Explain why
you\u2019re an excellent ﬁt for the role,
highlighting 2-3 key achievements, your
skills, and your enthusiasm for the
industry.
5. Third Paragraph : Conclude with a call to
action, such as expressing your eagerness

to discuss how you can contribute to the
company.
6. Formal Closing : End with a polite sign-oﬀ
like “Best regards,” followed by your name.
Tips for writing a
great cover letter
Choose the right template
Include comprehensive
contact details
A polished, visually appealing template
ensures you make a great ﬁrst impression.
Select one that is professional yet aligns with
the tone of the industry.
Choose from Jobscan’s library of cover letter
templates  to ensure your cover letter is
optimized for the ATS and readable for the
human hiring team.
Start your cover letter with a header
containing your full name, phone number,
email address, and the date. Optionally, you
can add social media proﬁles (e.g., LinkedIn ,
GitHub, or Medium) or a personal website if
they showcase your professional work.
At the very least, include your:

• 
• 
By oﬀering more options for hiring managers
to contact you and explore your work, you
can focus your cover letter content on how
your unique experience can help the
organization.
Personalizing your greeting shows eﬀort and
interest. If the name isn’t listed in the job
posting, research the company’s team or
department online, such as through LinkedIn
or their website.
“Dear hiring manager” or “To whom it may
concern” come across as dated and might
suggest to the hiring team that you’re not
tailoring your cover letter for the role.
Use your opening paragraph to grab
attention with 2-3 key accomplishments
relevant to the role. Avoid generic statements
and instead showcase your unique value.
Good Example

professional with a track record of
exceeding targets by 150% year-

over-year, I am excited to bring my
expertise in consultative selling
and relationship-building to Finite
Technology. During my time at XYZ
Corporation, I secured $1.2 million
in new business within six months
by identifying untapped market
opportunities and leveraging data-
driven strategies. Combined with
my Bachelor’s degree in Business
Administration, I am eager to
contribute my results-driven
approach to drive revenue growth

in the Sales Representative
position at your company. With my
background and experience, I
believe I could contribute to your
team and help achieve your goals. I
am conﬁdent that I am a strong
candidate for this role.
Remember, your cover letter isn’t the place to
repeat the content of your resume. Use the
cover letter to expand on the most relevant
parts of your resume and frame it around the
company you’re applying to. It’s about how
you can contribute to the organization.

Showcase your ﬁt for the
role
Align your skills and experiences with the job
description. Highlight speciﬁc achievements
that demonstrate your ability to excel in the
position. Help the hiring team imagine your
contributions to the role by providing speciﬁc
examples on how you’d approach the role.
Researching the company can help inform
how you tailor your cover letter, so it’s
important to scope out their LinkedIn,
company website, or any recent press to get
a sense of their current projects. Without
research and a thorough read of the job
description, you run the risk of your cover
letter sounding vague.

technical expertise, I thrive in fast-
paced environments where
continuous improvement and
cross-functional collaboration are
key, making me eager to
contribute to your dynamic
accounting team.
Bad Example
I am excited to apply for the Senior
Tax and Accounting Specialist
position at your company. With my

conﬁdent that I would be an asset
to your team. I have experience
working on various tax-related
tasks and am eager to bring my
skills to your organization. I am
highly organized, work well under
pressure, and am always willing to
take on new challenges.
Highlight company ﬁt
Research the company’s mission, values, or
culture and explain why they resonate with
you. Show how your values align with their
goals. Hiring teams aren’t just looking for
people who check the boxes of qualiﬁcations,
they also look for people who align with the
organizations main goals and values.

Proofread and Edit
Thoroughly
Keep It Concise
Stick to the 250-400 word range.
Ensure every sentence adds value
and avoid unnecessary repetition.
Match the Tone to the Industry
Adapt your writing style to ﬁt the
industry. A tech startup might
appreciate a more conversational
tone, while a legal ﬁrm likely
expects formality.
Use Action-Oriented Language
Opt for strong, dynamic verbs like
“managed,” “led,” “achieved,” or

You can ﬁnd this information in the job
description, often under the “Who we are”
section. If it’s not included in the job posting,
look at the “About Us” section of their
website or LinkedIn.
Conclude with a conﬁdent and polite call to
action, such as, “I would welcome the
opportunity to discuss how I can contribute
to your team” or “I look forward to discussing
this opportunity further.” This can be another
place to include your contact information.
Also, it never hurts to thank the hiring team
for their time in considering your application.
Double-check for grammatical or spelling
errors. A clean, error-free cover letter reﬂects
professionalism and attention to detail.
